It uses Git, a system for tracking changes in code, making it easier for teams to collaborate on software development projects. GitHub also hosts websites, project documentation, and other types of files, making it a central hub for developers, data scientists, and engineers to collaborate.

**Google Colab** is a free, cloud-based platform that allows users to write and execute Python code in a Jupyter notebook environment, with the added benefit of easily accessing powerful computing resources like GPUs and integrating with Google Drive for data storage.

**Streamlit** is an open-source Python library used to quickly create interactive and user-friendly web applications for data science and machine learning. Streamlit allows developers to build custom web interfaces with just a few lines of Python code, making it ideal for rapidly prototyping data-driven apps. It's commonly used to create dashboards, data visualizations, and AI tools, and requires no front-end programming skills.
