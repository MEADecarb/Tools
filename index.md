## Auto Attach (https://attachments-upohfiucnzxssapzzbwsuz.streamlit.app/)

Auto Attach Tool is designed to streamline the process of appending PDF and Word documents to existing Word files. Users can upload ZIP files containing documents and append additional PDFs or Word documents to them. The tool processes the uploaded files and combines them into a single ZIP output with all the documents neatly organized. This simplifies document management, particularly for batch processing of attachments. It also offers flexibility by allowing users to handle both PDF and Word files simultaneously or separately.
